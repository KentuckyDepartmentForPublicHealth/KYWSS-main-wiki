This wiki is for the primary KYWSS code repo. The KYWSS Code Repository is currently the catch-all for all KYWSS programming with both R and Python. The most important project is the wastewater data pipeline, which appends, validates, uploads to 1CDP, and calculates important metrics for our public and private dashboards and analyses (appending/validation/and upload is work in progress). The repo contains 10 routinely used scripts (9 python; 1 R) with over 2000 lines of custom code in total and 1200 additional lines of code adapted for use by KYWSS.
